What Is Jungle Disk?
====================

Jungle Disk is a multifaceted cloud backup software paired with network drive capabilities to help individuals or teams stay connected to their work, wherever they are.

Jungle Disk will allow you to:

* Backup data using your choice of Rackspace Cloud Files or Amazon S3.
* Protect data with AES-256 encryption using a key that you control.
* Share files between employees and securely access data from outside the office.
* Access and manage data remotely using any Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.

Backup Solutions
================
Jungle Disk has two central backup solutions, Simple Backup and the Backup Vault. These two solutions should be used together for maximum security and accessibility.

Simple Backup
-------------
This is an incremental backup that stores files which are accessible in full online. There is a hard size limitation of 5 GB per file. The Simple Backup is a convenient way to share files amongst teams.

Backup Vault
-------------
This is an incremental backup with data de-duplication. There is no file size limitation when backing up to the Backup Vault. However, files are compressed to save space and reduce user costs, so they are only available through the software's Restore Files operation. The Backup Vault best protects against data loss because it can store a large amount of information quickly and for a low cost.
