The Network Drive
=================

The network drive offers a convenient way to store and access files. It can be mapped to one of your computer's drives, allowing for easy synchronization onto the web. The network drive also stores Legacy Backups and Sync Folders.

The network drive can be used to temporarily store files, store files on a permanent basis, or share files with other users. There are a few ways to upload data into the network drive: via a legacy backup, copy/paste files from other folders into the network drive, and save files directly to the network drive from the program creating them (for example, in Word, click Files > Save As > select the network drive as the save destination).

.. Note:: Do not use the Cut option with files on the network drive! If an error occurs while the file has been cut, you could lose the file. Instead, use Copy and Paste, then delete the files in the old location.

Setting Up

The network drive is represented as a drive letter when mapped, such as J: or K:. You can assign a letter to the network drive during the first time setup wizard. Alternatively, go to Configure > expand the online disk (if available) > expand Network Drive > select Local Drive Mapping. After selecting the drive letter, you can access the network drive through the Computer section.
