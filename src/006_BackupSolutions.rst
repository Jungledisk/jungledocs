Before you choose a way to store your data, it's important to understand each type of backup.

Network Drive
=============
The Network Drive keeps files in the cloud for easy online access. These files are constantly updated to reflect the most current versions on your computer. If your computer gets a virus, though, the corrupted files will overwrite the ones stored in the network drive. For this reason, we always recommend using the backup vault in conjunction with the network drive.

The Network Drive also contains Legacy Backup and Sync Folders.

Legacy Backup
-------------
The Legacy Backup is the "meat" of the network drive. It stores full files without compression. So, if you have 15 GB of data within your backup set, you will have at 15 GB of storage space used (not including previous versions). Individual file size is restricted to 5 GB.

Sync Folders
------------
Sync folders are intended to be used by a single user and offer the ability to work with files when offline. They can be used to keep different computers in different locations synced with changes being made (i.e. home/work computer). Multiple users should utilize the Network Drive instead, as Sync Folders do not coordinate well across many machines. The sync process runs every 15 seconds, and for this reason, we recommend 10 GB or less stored on a sync folder. 

Backup Vault
============
The Backup Vault compresses and stores your files. Due to the way these files are packaged, data backed up to the Backup Vault is only available through the softwareâ€™s Restore Files section. They cannot be viewed through web access when stored in the backup vault. Since the backup schedule is not instant, your information won't be affected by a virus.
