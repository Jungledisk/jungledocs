Jungle Disk is a multifaceted cloud backup software paired with network drive capabilities to help individuals or teams stay connected to their work, wherever they are.

Jungle Disk will allow you to:

* Backup data using your choice of Rackspace Cloud Files or Amazon S3.
* Protect data with AES-256 encryption using a key that you control.
* Share files between employees and securely access data from outside the office.
* Access and manage data remotely using any Mac, Windows, or Linux computer.

Backup Solutions
================

Jungle Disk has two central backup solutions, Simple Backup and the Backup Vault.

Simple Backup
-------------
This is an DEF incremental backup that stores web-accessible full files. There is a hard file size limitation of 5 GB per file.

Backup Vault
-------------
This is an incremental backup with *data de-duplication. There is no file size limitation when backing up to the Backup Vault. Files are compressed to save space and money. Due to the way these files are packaged, compressed, and stored, data backed up to the Backup Vault is only available through the softwareâ€™s Restore Files operation.
